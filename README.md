# amatsukaze
~~A compiler of a home made DSL integrated within a Playground~~

A Playground server implemented with ANTLR and/or Kotlin DSL.

In the final release you will be able to choose from using my home made DSL or using Kotlin DSL.

~~**Please be aware that this project is discontinued has moved to [here](https://github.com/kokoro-aya/shizuku). 
The new project is subject to be refactored by introducing a better DSL implementation and a more completed playground
data structure. This repo will therefore be archived and few changes will be committed unless in case or urgency.**~~

The project is currently under refactoring using the Kotlin DSL in lieu of homemade DSL using ANTLR.
