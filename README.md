# Simulatte

A Playground server implemented with Kotlin DSL.

Inspired by Playgrounds on iOS/macOS and Karel the Robot, the project was first implemented using ANTLR. Later, it was 
migrated to the usage of Kotlin DSL.

See docs for how to launch the application, some test cases and a short language reference on Kotlin DSL used (a subset
of Kotlin language) by the application. These docs might be helpful for you to implement your
own client to communicate with the server.

**Warning**: The project is still in development and has great tons of bugs.

For example, by the moment you can't quit the program but you have to close the terminal in order to quit.

This project is part of the Project ironica.
